# Team Management

Manage your field service team — add technicians, set roles, define skills, and track availability.

## Adding Team Members

Navigate to **Settings → Team → Add Member** to invite a new team member.

### Roles
- **Admin** — Full access to all features and settings
- **Dispatcher** — Can create and assign jobs, manage schedule
- **Technician** — Can view assigned jobs, update status, add notes and photos

## Skills and Certifications

Tag technicians with their skills (e.g., "plumbing", "electrical", "HVAC") to enable smart job assignment.

## Availability

Set each technician's:
- Working hours (start/end time)
- Working days (Mon-Fri, weekends, etc.)
- Time off and vacation days

FieldCamp uses availability data to prevent scheduling conflicts and optimize dispatching.
