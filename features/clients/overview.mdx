# Client Management

FieldCamp's client management system is your complete CRM for field service businesses. Track every customer from first contact through lifetime value — contacts, jobs, invoices, communication history, and more.

## What is a Client?

A **client** in FieldCamp can be:
- An individual customer (homeowner, property manager)
- A business/company (property management firm, commercial building)
- A lead you're nurturing into a customer

Every client has a complete profile with contact details, addresses, job history, invoices, and communication records.

## Client Lifecycle Stages

Clients move through stages as you work with them:
