# Client List & Views

FieldCamp offers powerful list management with table views, kanban boards, grouping, filtering, and saved views. Organize thousands of clients efficiently.

## View Types

Switch between view types using the buttons in the toolbar:

### Table View

The default view shows clients in a sortable, filterable table.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/clients/client-table-view.png" alt="Client table view showing list of clients with sortable columns" />
</Frame>

**Features:**
- Multi-column sorting
- Inline editing (click any cell to edit)
- Bulk selection with checkboxes
- Column reordering (drag & drop headers)
- Show/hide columns
- Export to CSV/Excel

**Default Columns:**
- Client name
- Email
- Phone
- Property address (city)
- Stage
- Last activity date
- Lifetime value (total invoiced)

### Kanban Board View

Visual pipeline with drag-and-drop stage management.

{/* TODO: Screenshot of kanban board */}

Clients appear as cards organized into columns by stage:
- New Lead
- Active Client
- Inactive Client
- Archived

**Drag clients between stages** to update their status. Changes save automatically.

Each card shows:
- Client name and company
- Contact info
- Number of jobs
- Outstanding balance

### Grouped View

Organize clients into collapsible groups based on any field.

{/* TODO: Screenshot of grouped view */}

**Common grouping options:**
- By City (see all clients in each service area)
- By Assigned Tech (see each team member's clients)
- By Stage (similar to kanban but with full details)
- By Lead Source (track which marketing channels work best)
- By Custom Property (any custom field)

**Group pagination:**
- Control how many groups appear per page
- Set records per group
- Expand/collapse individual groups

## Filtering Clients

Build complex filters to find exactly the clients you need.

### Quick Filters

Use the stage tabs at the top:
- **All** - every client
- **Leads** - only New Lead stage
- **Active** - Active Client stage
- **Inactive** - Inactive Client stage
- **Archived** - Archived clients

### Advanced Filters

Click **Filter** to build custom filter rules:

1. Select a field (name, email, stage, city, etc.)
2. Choose a condition:
   - **Contains** - text appears anywhere
   - **Equals** - exact match
   - **Starts with** - text at beginning
   - **Greater than / Less than** - for numbers and dates
   - **Is empty / Is not empty**
3. Enter a value
4. Click **Add Filter** to combine multiple rules

**Example filters:**

<CodeGroup>
```text Find VIP clients in New York
Field: City → Equals → New York
AND
Field: Tags → Contains → VIP
```

```text Inactive clients with outstanding balance
Field: Stage → Equals → Inactive Client
AND
Field: Balance → Greater than → 0
```

```text Leads added in the last 7 days
Field: Created Date → Greater than → (7 days ago)
```
</CodeGroup>

Filters apply to table, kanban, and grouped views.

## Sorting Clients

### Single Column Sort

Click any column header to sort:
- First click: ascending (A→Z, 0→9)
- Second click: descending (Z→A, 9→0)
- Third click: remove sort

### Multi-Column Sort

Click **Sort** in the toolbar to build complex sorts:

1. Add primary sort (e.g., City A→Z)
2. Add secondary sort (e.g., Last Name A→Z)
3. Add tertiary sort (e.g., Created Date newest first)

Useful for organizing lists like:
- By City, then by Street
- By Assigned Tech, then by Last Activity Date
- By Stage, then by Lifetime Value (highest first)

## Searching Clients

Use the search box (top left) for instant text search across:
- First name and last name
- Company name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Street address

Search is fuzzy-matched and case-insensitive.

## Column Management

### Show/Hide Columns

Click the **Columns** button to:
- Check boxes for visible columns
- Uncheck to hide columns you don't need

Hidden columns are still searchable and filterable.

### Reorder Columns

Drag column headers left/right to reorder. Your column order is saved per user.

### Resize Columns

Drag the column separator to resize. FieldCamp remembers your column widths.

## Saved Views

Save your filter/sort/group/column combinations as named views.

### Creating a Saved View

1. Set up your ideal filters, sorting, grouping, and columns
2. Click **Save View**
3. Name it (e.g., "NYC VIP Clients", "Leads This Week", "Inactive with Balance")
4. Click **Save**

### Using Saved Views

Click the view dropdown (next to **Save View**) to switch between:
- Default view (no filters)
- Your saved views
- Shared team views (if admin created them)

Saved views persist across sessions and devices.

### Editing a View

1. Load the view
2. Change filters/sorting/columns as needed
3. Click **Update View** to save changes

### Sharing Views (Admins Only)

Admins can share views with the entire team:
1. Create a view
2. Check **Share with team**
3. Save

Shared views appear in everyone's view dropdown.

## Bulk Operations

Select multiple clients using checkboxes (left column):

### Bulk Actions Available:
- **Export** - download selected clients to CSV/Excel
- **Delete** - remove multiple clients (with confirmation)
- **Change Stage** - move all selected to a new stage
- **Assign Tech** - set preferred technician for all
- **Add Tags** - bulk tagging

{/* TODO: Screenshot of bulk actions */}

<Warning>
  **Bulk delete** will fail if any selected client has active jobs. Use **Force Delete** (with caution) to cascade delete jobs and related data.
</Warning>

### Selecting Clients

- **Click checkbox** - select single client
- **Click header checkbox** - select all on current page
- **Select All** button (above table) - select all matching current filters (even across pages)

Selection persists across page navigation within the same filter/view.

## Pagination

Control how many clients appear per page:

- 10 per page (fast loading, more clicking)
- 30 per page (default, balanced)
- 50 per page (fewer page changes)
- 100 per page (maximum)
- **All** (no pagination, loads everything - use with filters!)

Page controls:
- ← Prev / Next → buttons
- Jump to page number
- Current page indicator (e.g., "Page 3 of 12")

<Tip>
  For large client lists (1000+), use filters and grouping to reduce the result set before setting pagination to "All".
</Tip>

## View Permissions

What you see depends on your role:

| Role | What You See |
|------|--------------|
| **Owner/Admin** | All clients in organization |
| **Manager** | All clients (if "View All" permission) OR only assigned clients |
| **Technician** | Only clients assigned to them |
| **Custom Role** | Based on Clients module permissions (View All / View Assigned) |

Admins can configure per-role permissions in **Settings → Team → Roles**.

## Mobile View

On phones and tablets, the client list switches to a card layout:

{/* TODO: Screenshot of mobile card view */}

Each card shows:
- Client name and company
- Phone (tap to call)
- Email (tap to email)
- Property address (tap for directions)
- Stage badge
- Swipe actions (delete, edit, view details)

Filters, search, and sorting still work in mobile view.

## Performance Tips

For large client databases (5,000+ clients):

1. **Use filters** before loading "All" pagination
2. **Save filtered views** for common queries
3. **Group by fields with few unique values** (stage, city) rather than many (name)
4. **Hide unnecessary columns** to speed up table rendering
5. **Use search** instead of scrolling through pages

FieldCamp indexes clients for fast queries on:
- Stage
- Created date
- Deleted status
- Integration IDs (Xero, Wave, QuickBooks)

## Exporting Client Lists

Export the current view (with filters applied) to:
- **CSV** - import into Excel, Google Sheets
- **Excel (.xlsx)** - formatted spreadsheet

Exported files include all visible columns for selected/filtered clients.

To export:
1. Apply desired filters
2. (Optional) Select specific clients
3. Click **Export**
4. Choose CSV or Excel
5. File downloads automatically
