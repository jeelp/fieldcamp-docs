### Addresses

FieldCamp supports three address types for each client:

#### Property Address

- Auto-geocoded to latitude/longitude for maps

Fields:
- Street address
- House/Building number
- City
- State/Province
- Country

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of address autocomplete -->

<Tip>
  **Address Autocomplete:** Start typing and FieldCamp will suggest addresses via Google Places API. Selecting a suggestion auto-fills all address fields and geocodes the location.
</Tip>

#### Billing Address
Where invoices are sent (if different from property address). Useful for:
- Property management companies
- Commercial clients with separate billing departments
- Rental properties billed to landlords

#### Company Address
For commercial clients' headquarters or main office.

### Advanced Coordinate Entry

For precise GPS locations, you can enter coordinates in multiple formats:

<CodeGroup>
```text Decimal Degrees (DD)
40.7128, -74.0060
```

```text Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS)
40°42'46"N 74°0'22"W

FieldCamp automatically parses and converts to latitude/longitude.

## Editing Clients

To edit an existing client:

1. Click the client row in the Clients table
2. Edit any field inline or via the detail modal
3. Changes save automatically

### Change History

Every edit is tracked in the client's history:
- Which field was changed
- Old value → New value
- Who made the change
- Timestamp

Access change history via the **Activity** tab on the client detail page.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of change history -->

<Warning>
  Editing a client's stage will update their `conversionDate` if moving to "Active Client" for the first time.
</Warning>

## Validation Rules

FieldCamp validates client data on save:

| Field | Validation |
|-------|------------|
| Email | Must be valid email format (RFC 5322) |
| Phone | Must be valid for selected country (via libphonenumber) |
| Website | Must be valid URL |
| Address | Must geocode successfully (if entered) |

Invalid data will show an error message and prevent saving until corrected.

## Automatic Client Creation

Clients are created automatically when you:

1. **Create a job** and enter a new customer name
2. **Receive a booking** via the client portal
3. **Import from integrations** (QuickBooks, Xero, Wave)

Auto-created clients will have minimal information (name only). Edit them later to add addresses and contact details.

## Duplicate Detection

<Info>
  **Coming soon:** FieldCamp will detect potential duplicates based on:
  - Matching email addresses
  - Similar names + same address
  - Identical phone numbers
  
  You'll be prompted to merge or keep as separate records.
